# 3D Design & Assembly
To assemble the product, this page has been prepared for the developer or production employee to assemble the product together.

# Build instructions
***UNDER CONSTRUCTION**: This section will include:*
- *Bill of Materials*
- *Mechanical assembly instructions*
- *Electronics/Wiring instructions*

## Bill of materials
### 3D Printable
3D Printable files are found in [/CAD/3D Models (To Print)](../STL)
- [Base](../STL/Base.STL)
- [Backplate](../STL/Base.STL)
- [Battery Box](../STL/Base.STL)
- [Water Compartment](../STL/Base.STL)

*Optional*
- [Logo](../STL/Base.STL)
- [Box Design](../STL/Base.STL)
### Non 3D Printable
Some parts such as the mechanical parts or electrical parts cannot be printed. These must be purchased. The printed circuit board can be developed yourself. Read the Circuit Board section for this. The purchase of the printed circuit board can be done at BAVA Solutions.

### Electronic components
- **Circuit Board** Provider by BAVA Solutions (Or see Circuit Board Section)
- **TVOC Sensor** Sensor CCS811
- **Temperature Sensor** Bosch BME280 
- **Battery** 1S LiPo Aprox 3200 mAh

### Mechanical components
- **1x** Hot Glue Gun with sticks

# Mechanical assembly

### Step 1: Print the base element

  The first step of assembly is to print the [base](../STL/Base.stl) element of the product. From this object it is possible to connect the rest of the elements.
  Print the basic element and lay it flat on the table with the open cloth outwards.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
